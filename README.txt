I start to write arduino tutorial using pure C language.
Please download arduino IDE.
If your arduino doesn't see USB driver, you need to download and install USB-SERIAL CH340 driver.
You can find atmega328p reference manual and pinout diagram for arduino UNO in docs directory,
it can help you to understand this tutorials and you can write your own projects.
